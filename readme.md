# The Camelot experience
![](img/website.gif)<br>
The camelot experience is supposed to simulate a website for family vacations. However, it is set in the fictional Camelot.
It mimics the excursion family ticket prices i.e the zoo, museums, etc.
### Struggles and Wins
I was struggling with the media query to make the site responsive. I realized that instead of making the site a certain width, I should set the width to automatically size to the width of the device it is viewed on.<br> I accomplished this by setting the width in the media query to auto.This was a great revelation after peak stress levels. 
### The Technologies
I used equal parts html and css for this project. A little javascript used as well. The animations were done in css via keyframes and scale. The site is primarily flexbox.<br>
The changing of the colors on the title and when you hover over a specific clickable portion of the page was all done in css. The buttons on the nav bar also change size when you hover over them.<br>
I also made the nav bar fixed so whenever you scroll down the page, the nav bar follows you. I did this in css.<br>
The event handlers(clicks) I did in javascript. I also was able to create the modal in html and css. The functionality is javascript.
